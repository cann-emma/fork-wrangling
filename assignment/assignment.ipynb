However, without an example or dataset to base the definition of variable and observation on, the two terms in themselves can be hard to explain.\n",

        "**Q3.** Many important datasets contain a race variable, typically limited to a handful of values often including Black, White, Asian, Latino, and Indigenous. This question looks at data gathering efforts on this variable by the U.S. Federal government.\n",

        "1. How did the most recent US Census gather data on race?\n",
        "    * The US Census gathers race data using self-identification on the Census survey.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Why do we gather these data? What role do these kinds of data play in politics and society? Why does data quality matter?\n",
        "    * Race plays a huge rule in politics and society. Gathering data on race can help in understanding or better perceiving and addressing inequalities between races. Data quality matters because if these inequalities or issues are to be addressed appropriately, the data must reflect reality.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Please provide a constructive criticism of how the Census was conducted: What was done well? What do you think was missing? How should future large scale surveys be adjusted to best reflect the diversity of the population? Could some of the Census' good practices be adopted more widely to gather richer and more useful data?\n",
        "    * Because the  Census collects data on a lot of people, the methodology/ the fact that it is a survey makes sense. Surveys can reach a lot of people faster and you can get results more easily. However, a survey only works if participants are willing to answer the questions on them, and answer them truthfully. This means that while a survey is a great way for obtaining large scale data, it is not the best as non-response is frequent and some participants can 'lie' or misinterpret survey questions or present false information if they are self-identifying or self-reporting. These issues can be addressed by framing questions more clearly, providing surveys in multiple languages, and providing more options that represent diveristy so people respond more appropraitely. These adjustments to the census survey can help analyze certain nuances in data and in the groups they represent.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. How did the Census gather data on sex and gender? Please provide a similar constructive criticism of their practices.\n",
        "    * The Census asked respondents to report identify only as either Female or Male. This limitation especially when it comes to gender will make our data unrepresentative as the diversity of gender is not represented.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. When it comes to cleaning data, what concerns do you have about protected characteristics like sex, gender, sexual identity, or race? What challenges can you imagine arising when there are missing values? What good or bad practices might people adopt, and why?\n",
        "\n",
        "    * When it comes to cleaning data, protected characteristics are most likely to be missing so it is important to explore the pattern of missingness. When there are missing values, it is important to examine why the data might be missing so you know how better to handle it, otherwise you stand missing a lot of insight from data, by removing or excluding missing data. Sometimes, removing data is appropriate for the missingness pattern, sometime imputing data is appropriate. However, it is difficult to determine what values to impute especially for categorical variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Suppose someone invented an algorithm to impute values for protected characteristics like race, gender, sex, or sexuality. What kinds of concerns would you have?\n",
        "\n",
        "      * If someone built an algorithm that imputed values for protected characteristics, I would be curious about how the algorithm was built. What data was used to inform it about what values to impute, and is the data representative or skewed in favor of majority groups. For instance, how likely is the algorithm to impute heterosexual because it has high frequency? What metrics are being used to determine that the imputation is something other than heterosexual?"
